What genes are co-expressed with those in set FAcore? 

TCGA (all tissues) and GTEx (all tissues), and GDSC (cell lines).

- retrieve gene expression data 
- run analysis to identify co-expression clusters

"- Blue team (Theo) took ownership of implementing this query, based on their expertise and data sources.
- Need to define set of condistions under which co-expression/clustering  is assessed."
