What genes show high phenotypic similarity to those in set FAcore?

HPO, MODs (via Monarch)

a - retrieve ids of all orthologes of genes in set FAcore -> set Q7-1
b - retrieve phenotypes of genes in set FAcore  and  Q7-1 (orthologs of FAcore)
c - run phenosim analysis to generate ranked list of phenotypically similar genes across species
d - retrieve human orthologs of top hits -> set Q7-FAx
