## API development guidelines for NCATS translator project

This document summarizes the common guidelines we want to follow when developing new (or converting existing) APIs for the *blackboard* system, which will be used to answer the competency questions for NCATS translator project.

Just a few quick notes first:

* The response objects returned from an API should be an entity. See [entity types]() below.
* Each entity type should have a defined "_id" field. See [entity types]() below.
* An API should support both the query by _id, and batch query by a list of _id.
